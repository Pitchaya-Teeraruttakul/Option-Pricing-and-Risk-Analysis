# Options Pricing and Risk Analysis

This project implements option pricing models using the **Black-Scholes formula** and **Monte Carlo simulation**, with the goal of analyzing pricing accuracy and 
understanding risk under various market conditions.

- Gain hands-on experience with financial modeling and quantitative analysis
- Simulate option pricing under real-world assumptions

## 📌 Key Features

- Black-Scholes closed-form solution for European options
- Monte Carlo simulation for path-dependent options
- Python implementation with data visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git for version control
